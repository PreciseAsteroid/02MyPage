            <h3><a href="#">What I am looking for</a></h3>

            <p>Product Management position that will allow me to build the next big thing, impact the lives of millions
                and change the world (2 out of 3 is also ok).
                Of course I will not be doing that alone...so I am looking for a heterogeneous group of people that
                strives for excellence, encourages criticism and will make me sweat.
                And last but not least, a fun place to work at
            </p>

            <h3><a href="#">What I bring to the table</a></h3>

            <p>Extensive product related experience of different disciplines and industries, from in-car consumer apps
                to corporate business suites mixed with technical background and experience.
                The ability to think differently and the courage to speak up.
                The secret of conveying a clear and concise message on stage, over the phone and with the written word.

            <h4>Sr. Product Manager- Connected Cars (01/2013 –Current)</h4>
            <h5>SAP</h5>

            <p>Taking an active part in SAP’s attempt to change the automotive industry with disruptive business models
                that tie together auto makers (OEMs), service providers and technology startups. The result is a
                delightful driver experience that leads to additional revenue to all parties in the network.
                My work in this project includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Initiating Biz Dev activities to recruit technology startups companies alongside well established
                    companies to the network and come up with innovative connected car scenarios.
                </li>
                <li>Leading PoCs’ tech streams and workshops together with the OEMs to prove the viability of the
                    concept in real life scenarios. During these events I worked directly with senior and executive
                    levels of the leading OEMs.
                </li>
                <li>Defining the platform’s OData data model as well as the expected interaction of the REST APIs that
                    realize the connected car’s scenarios.
